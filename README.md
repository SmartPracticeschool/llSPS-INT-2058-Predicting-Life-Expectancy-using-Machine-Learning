# Project Description:

A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.

Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.

# Where do we get data to predict the life expectancy?

The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries the data-sets are made available to the public for the purpose of health data analysis. The dataset related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries have been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from the United Nations website. Among all categories of health-related factors, only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative

# Why do we use big datasets?

To get the accurate solutions of the problem. When we train the Machine Learning Model by using more datasets. Then there is possibility of getting accurate results
